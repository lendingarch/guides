Best Practices
==============

A guide for programming well.

General
-------

* These are not to be blindly followed; strive to understand these and ask
  when in doubt.
* Don't duplicate the functionality of a built-in library.
* Don't swallow exceptions or "fail silently."
* Don't write code that guesses at future functionality.
* Exceptions should be exceptional.
* [Keep the code simple].

Object-Oriented Design
----------------------

* Avoid global variables.
* Avoid long parameter lists.
* Limit collaborators of an object (entities an object depends on).
* Limit an object's dependencies (entities that depend on an object).
* Prefer small methods. Between one and five lines is best.
* Prefer small classes with a single, well-defined responsibility. When a
  class exceeds 100 lines, it may be doing too many things.
* [Tell, don't ask].

Postgres
--------

* Never use multi-column primary keys.
* Avoid multicolumn indexes in Postgres. It [combines multiple indexes]
  efficiently. 
* Consider a [partial index] for queries on booleans.
* Constrain most columns as [`NOT NULL`].

Background Jobs

HTML
----

* Don't use a reset button for forms.
* Prefer cancel links to cancel buttons.
* Use `<button>` tags over `<a>` tags for actions.

CSS
---

* Use Sass.

Sass
----

* Prefer `overflow: auto` to `overflow: scroll`, because `scroll` will always
  display scrollbars outside of OS X, even when content fits in the container.
* Use `image-url` and `font-url`, not `url`, so the asset pipeline will re-write
  the correct paths to assets.

Browsers
--------

* Don't support versions of Internet Explorer before IE9.
