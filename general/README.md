### Failure

Failure is inevitable, but it's not fatal. Denial is fatal. Failure caught early is just learning.

* don't be afraid to admit error or failure
* embrace failure
* fail fast and communicate fast
* Be honest and direct
  * own up to the mistakes you made

* take responsibility actively
** Expect to be held accountable for it
* when you make a mistake (as we all do...) or error in judgement, admit it honestly and try to offer options.
* Don't blame someone or something else, or make up excusses. 
  * Focus on solutions, not blame

* Talk to the duck
  * When you feel angry or frustrated and want to blame someone, **talk to the duck first**, before talking to people.
