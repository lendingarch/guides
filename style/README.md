Python
------

* Follow [PEP 8].
[PEP 8]: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
* An exception to PEP 8 is our rules on line lengths. Donâ€™t limit lines of code to 79 characters if it means the code looks significantly uglier or is harder to read. We allow up to 119 characters as this is the width of GitHub code review; anything longer requires horizontal scrolling which makes review more difficult.
